# CocaCola-Valuation-2025
Valuation of The Coca-Cola Company (2025) using DCF and Comparable Companies Analysis.
Coca-Cola (KO) Valuation – DCF + Comps

This is my first attempt at understanding how financial valuation works.
I’m an 18-year-old Computer Engineering student with no commerce background. I came across a few online posts a few weeks ago about DCF valuation. Well, I have always thought about transitioning to Finance and university that is prestigious for Finance. Therefore, while satisfying my curiosity I came across this and took on the challenge of making one.

And, instead of reading only theory, I wanted to learn practically. That’s how this project started.

What This Project Includes:

I built a basic model in Excel with:

5-Year Projections

Revenue

Cost of Goods Sold(COGS)

Operating expenses

Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)

Free Cash Flow (FCFF)

DCF Valuation

Discounting future cash flows

Terminal value

Enterprise value

Equity value

Intrinsic share price

Comparable Company Analysis

Using simple valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA and P/E) of peers like Pepsi, Monster, KDP, Celsius, and Coca-Cola Femsa.

Summary + Charts

Revenue chart

FCFF chart

Valuation comparison

Final blended price

Investment thesis

Risks

Final recommendation

This is a simple beginner-friendly structure, but it helped me understand the logic behind valuation.

The main results that I got even after being stuck for a lot of time,
DCF Price: ~$54.70
Comps Price Range: ~$51–52
Final Fair Value Estimate: ~$52–53
Recommendation: Hold (looks fairly valued)

These are my learnings from the project:
How revenue and expenses flow into cash flow
What FCFF actually means
Why companies discount future money
How terminal value works
How multiples like EV/EBITDA and P/E are used
How valuation is more about reasoning than memorizing formulas

And most importantly, this project fascinated me on how easy it can be to valuate companies.
