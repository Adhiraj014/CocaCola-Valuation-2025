# Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses = Revenue × Operating Expense %

# EBIT
EBIT = Revenue – COGS – Operating Expenses

# Taxes

# Present Value of FCFF
PV of FCFF = FCFF × Discount Factor

# Terminal Value
Terminal Value = Last Year FCFF × (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) / (WACC – Terminal Growth Rate)

# PV of Terminal Value
PV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value × Discount Factor (Final Year)
